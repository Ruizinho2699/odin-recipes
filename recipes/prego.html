       <p>It’s essentially a garlic steak sandwich, known for its tender meat and aromatic seasoning.</p> 
       <p>The word ‘prego’ in Portuguese means ‘nail,’ related to the ‘nailing’ of the garlic-infused steak to the bread.</p> 
       <p>Paying homage to the “nail,” when preparing this dish, it is often encouraged to nail the garlic into the meat.</p>
       <p>Soaking the meat in one of Portugal’s classic beers, Sagres or Superbock, ties the sandwich even closer to the Portuguese culture.</p>
